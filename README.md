### **_The Proccess_**

While planning out this project, I felt relatively confident in my skills going into the process. Auth errors drove me crazy and it felt like it would never end. With some assistance from some peers, I was able to implement authentication with a token. I underestimated the time expected to build out the features I wanted to present but nevertheless, I am happy with the product I constructed.
